### Data Preprocessing Documentation

#### 1. Raw Data Cleaning:
- Dropped duplicate rows in both datasets.
- Standardized column names to lowercase and stripped extra spaces.
- Filled missing values:
  - **Numeric columns**: Imputed using the median.
  - **Categorical columns**: Imputed using the mode.

#### 2. Handling Categorical Variables:
- Identified categorical columns: 'team', 'position', and 'conference'.
- Applied the following techniques:
  - **Imputation**: Filled missing values with the most frequent value.
  - **Feature Engineering**: Created a 'team_code' column by mapping team names to unique numeric codes.
  - **Encoding**: One-hot encoded the 'position' (players) and 'conference' (teams) columns.

#### 3. Scaling:
- Standardized all numerical features using `StandardScaler` to ensure uniformity.

#### 4. Data Merging:
- Merged the players and teams datasets on the newly created 'team_code' column for seamless integration.

#### 5. Final Dataset:
- Saved the cleaned and processed datasets as 'cleaned_players.csv', 'cleaned_teams.csv', and 'final_combined.csv' for future use.
